Hey everyone- welcome to Day 1 (or 2, if ya count us kicking off!) of Build Weeks.
Here is a very broad idea -hand opening wide gesture- but helpful estimation of where ya should be by the end of today:
:globe_with_meridians: WEB
Unit 2:
Decide once and for all which design system you want to use for the front end- whether that is something like Styled Components, Reactstrap/Bootstrap, or just plain ’ol CSS. Best to nail this down ASAP and not change gears later on in the week!
(Again, by tomorrow) You’ll want to ensure that your front end is able to pull -some- kind of data, whether that is dummy data from the unit 4 API or something like the Pokemon API :pikawow: https://pokeapi.co/  the main thing is that the React application can speak to the  :sparkles: outside world :sparkles:
Unit 3:
Same as above for unit 2 :point_up:: main thing is that we want to ensure that your front end React application can pull from the outside. localhost:3000 is the homie always but we want to ensure that we’re not going to find any fun, unexpected CORS issues at the last minute!
If you are working with some kind of authentication for user login / registration flow, you’ll want to have that considered and reasonably sketched out by EOD tomorrow. Note that I am not expecting you to be done- but that the ball is rolling in that direction!
Unit 4:
All of your Node packages and dependencies- production and dev- are installed (Express, Nodemon, CORS, body-parser, anything!) and in your package.json file.
The React app frontend can talk with your API- dummy data is your friend here, shooting for a status of 200 is the main thing here, just so we can establish some hello world action, that’s the goal.
Data migrations and seeds are ready to go.
:abacus:  DATA SCIENCE
Units 3 and 4:
Load initial (possibly sampled/manual) data
Create exploratory notebook considering appropriate methods to address business problem
