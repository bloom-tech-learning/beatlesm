#  Module 3.1.1 Project Class - Components
Today we will learn all about classes in React. Then, we will use classes to build out our components. Class components have been a big part of the React ecosystem because they brought a lot of functionality that we normally didn't get with the React API when using function components. Now with hooks, that functionality is available in function components. However, many projects will still have class components in them, and we need to be prepared to work with classes when we see them.
