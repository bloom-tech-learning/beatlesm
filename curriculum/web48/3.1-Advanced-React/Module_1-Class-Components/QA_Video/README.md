:memo: the render function - A pre-defined function that allows for a class component to render DOM objects.
:memo: the this property - A reference to the current instance of a class. In class components, the place where props, state and internally defined event methods are accessed.
:memo: filter - An array method that take a predicate function as an argument returns every item that where that function return true.
:memo: super - A built in function that give a child class access to a parent class' methods and properties.
Key Concepts:
:memo: The History of React Components : React components have changed alot through the years.
:memo: Prop Drilling - The process of taking a value and passing it into a nested component for use downstream.
:memo: Passing State through Data Prop Drilling - The process of sharing application state to subcomponents using prop drilling.
:memo: Updating State through Functional Prop Drilling - The process of sharing application state to subcomponents using prop drilling.
:memo: Application State Vs Component State - Application state indicates the state shared by a number of components. Component State indicates state local only to a components internal parts.
:memo: Form Component Setup - The process of setting up (component) state, controlled inputs, onChange and onSubmit events to allow component form submission.
