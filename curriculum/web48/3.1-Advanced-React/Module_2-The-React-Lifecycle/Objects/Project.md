#  Module 3.1.2 Project - The React Lifecycle

Every component in React has what we call a lifecycle. The lifecycle is a part of how our components operate under the hood. Being able to demonstrate understanding of the React component lifecycle by knowing how to use a few of the "Methods" provided by it will help you understand how and why React behaves the way it does at times.
