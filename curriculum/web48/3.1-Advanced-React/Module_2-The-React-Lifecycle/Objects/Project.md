#  Module 3.1.2 Project - The React Lifecycle

Every component in React has what we call a lifecycle. The lifecycle is a part of how our components operate under the hood. Being able to demonstrate understanding of the React component lifecycle by knowing how to use a few of the "Methods" provided by it will help you understand how and why React behaves the way it does at times.

##  Module Project
[React Github User Card](https://github.com/bloominstituteoftechnology/web-module-project-lifecycle)

Rebuild the Github User Card app, but this time with React. In this project, you will fetch the data and manage state in class components.
