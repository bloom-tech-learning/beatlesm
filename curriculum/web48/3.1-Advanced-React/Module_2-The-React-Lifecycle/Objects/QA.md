-   class component - [A type of component that takes the form of a class extended from React.Component class.](https://www.w3schools.com/react/react_components.asp)

-   class constructor - [A class method that is called when an instance is first created of from a class.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes/constructor)
-   the render function - [A pre-defined function that allows for a class component to render DOM objects.](https://reactjs.org/docs/components-and-props.html)
-   the this property - [A reference to the current instance of a class. In class components, the place where props, state and internally defined event methods are accessed.](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_this.asp)

##  Key Concepts:
-   The History of React Components : [React components have changed alot through the years.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Kzeog8yTFaE)
-   Prop Drilling - [The process of taking a value and passing it into a nested component for use downstream.](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/prop-drilling)
-   Passing State through Data Prop Drilling - [The process of sharing application state to subcomponents using prop drilling.](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-pass-props-to-component#react-props-vs-state)
-   Updating State through Functional Prop Drilling - [The process of sharing application state to subcomponents using prop drilling.](https://www.robinwieruch.de/react-pass-props-to-component#react-props-vs-state)
-   Application State Vs Component State - [Application state indicates the state shared by a number of components. Component State indicates state local only to a components internal parts.](https://teamtreehouse.com/community/what-is-the-difference-between-application-state-and-component-state-in-react)
