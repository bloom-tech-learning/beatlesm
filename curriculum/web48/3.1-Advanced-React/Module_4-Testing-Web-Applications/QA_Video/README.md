##   Key Terminology:
-   RTL querys - [React Testing Library queries allow uses to select elements from the DOM for testing.](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/cheatsheet/)
-   ARIA roles - [DOM elements that have role attributes automatically assigned to them.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)
-   expect - [expect is a jest method used to test the value of an element](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/expect.html)
-   userEvent / fireEvent - [userEvent is a react testing library method used to simulate user input. userEvent is a more advanced and simplified version of fireevent.](https://testing-library.com/docs/ecosystem-user-event/)
-   regular expressions - [A regular expression (shortened as regex or regexp) is a sequence of characters that define a search pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sXQxhojSdZM)
-   async / await - [A javascript idea that allows for a more streamline processing of promises.](https://javascript.info/async-await)
##  Concepts:
-   end-to-end tests - [a testing method that involves testing an application’s workflow from beginning to end. This method basically aims to replicate real user scenarios.](https://www.browserstack.com/guide/end-to-end-testing)
-   integration tests - [A method of software testing where individual components or units of code are tested to validate user interactions.](https://www.testingxperts.com/blog/what-is-integration-testing#What%20is%20Integration%20Testing?)
-   unit tests - [A level of software testing where individual units / components of a software are tested. The purpose is to validate that each unit of the software performs as designed.](https://softwaretestingfundamentals.com/unit-testing/)
-   react testing library - [a light-weight solution for testing React components.](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/)
-   test driven development - [A programming methodology that encourages early testing and later ui development](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y8TcPr73Bwo)
