#  Module 3.2.2 Redux

React is a very sophisticated UI-component library that can be used with a few other libraries to build large-scale single-page applications. But as our applications scale in size, so will the data we are concerned with within our applications. And you can only start to imagine how difficult it might be to manage all of that data inside React components. Redux is a library that can help solve this problem by providing a single source of truth for our data within our application. As your team grows and as your application scales, Redux can help offset the pains that can be brought on due to complexity.

##  Module Project

In this project, you are given the skeleton/structure/styling of a React app. There is even some state built-in for you. Your job will be to implement React-Redux as the state management system for this application.
