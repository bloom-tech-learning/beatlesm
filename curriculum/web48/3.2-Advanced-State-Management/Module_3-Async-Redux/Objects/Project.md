#  Module 3.2.3 - Async Redux

By nature Redux is synchronous. Because of this, we need to apply some Middleware to extend the functionality of our Redux package to allow for things like promises (which are asynchronous). This module will teach you how to set up Redux-Thunk as a Middleware for Redux. You will also learn how to use the Redux-Thunk package to extend your actions so that you can consume promises.
