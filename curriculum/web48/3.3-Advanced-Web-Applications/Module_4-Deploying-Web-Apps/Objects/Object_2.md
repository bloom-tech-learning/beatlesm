#   Objective 2 - Explain What it Means to Deploy a Static Website

##  Overview

The internet is a great tool, but it would be useless without data to share with users. Most data on the web is shared through websites and web applications. Let's talk about how these sites are made available on the web through ```deployment```.

### Web App Deployment

Web apps are made up of code - primarily JavaScript. When we want to deploy our web app to the world wide web, we need to host that project on a web server to serve up to people connected to the web. Many services allow you to "rent" server space for your web app. You can deploy web apps to ```Amazon AWS servers```, ```Google Servers```, ```Netlify, Heroku```, ```Gatsby```, ```Github Pages```, and ```Vercel``` (which we'll learn about in this module) among many, many others.

Services like these are a huge step up in modern technology that allows us to deploy sites with the click of a button or right in your terminal. Today, we are lucky to do this with so much ease, at least compared to the "good ol' days."

### Static vs Dynamic Apps

Deploying a static web app is a little different than deploying a dynamic web app. Most of the apps that you have built up to this point are static apps. A basic definition of a static site has hardcoded data that doesn't change. A lot of our React apps use data from third-party libraries but still deploy like a static app.

Deploying a site with an accompanying server and database will be more complicated than just an almost static site that consumes a third-party API. We'll learn more about that kind of deployment in the backend unit.

## Challenge

Now that you've learned what it means to deploy a static web app, do a search online for potential problems that you may face during or after your project is deployed.
